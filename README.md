# Code Nest ‚Äì Full-Stack MERN Blog Platform

Code Nest is a comprehensive full-stack blogging platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Designed to emulate a real-world production application, it provides a seamless experience for both readers and content administrators. The platform includes user authentication, role-based permissions, a powerful admin dashboard, dynamic content management, and a modern, responsive UI.
This project was an intensive deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on security, scalability, and user-friendly design.

###  4. Configure Environment Variables  
Backend (/api/.env)  

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
SECRET=your_jwt_secret

BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
EMAIL_SENDER=your_verified_sender_email
EMAIL_RECEIVER=your_email_for_notifications
SEND_AUTOREPLY=true
```
Frontend (/client/.env)  

```env
